# Electrical-Engg--Visualization-of-Rotating-Magnetic-Field
# A rotating magnetic field can be defined as the field or flux having constant amplitude but whose axis is continuously rotating in a plane with a certain speed.
# When a 3-phase winding is energized from a 3-phase supply, a rotating magnetic field is produced.
